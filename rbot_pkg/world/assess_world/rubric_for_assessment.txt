rubric for assessment

bare pass needs these first three elements 
create a urdf model of a robot that will load in ignition gazebo in the assessment world

create a README file for the repository with instructions for how to load the file, and any other instructions to use the functionality you have developed

On visual inspection the design would be able to move the balls in some way, and is an appropriate size/design to navigate the maze

better grade
The robot can move in gazebo using a teleoperation node of some sort
Collision models exist so that your model interacts correctly with the simulated world

You have a launch file to launch all of those things
you will have been regularly updating the repo in labcode, and the project shows a clear progression

add sensors to the model to enable teleoperation without the gui of ignition

best grades (you do not need to do all these, but significant development in one, or a lower level of development in more than one)
you could develop an easier to use gui than the teloperation in a terminal window (rqt)
you develop some level of autonomy
you implement methods that would enable the task to be completed more efficiently
you may be using advanced techniques in git like branching
